# FestAppTabs
As part of the ERASMUS exchange program as a Mobile Media student at Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart, 
I designed and developed a software mobile application for Android.

CONCEPT
The concept of this mobile application, further referred as FestApp (FA) is to create a system 
which helps user to search for music festivals around Europe, buy tickets and keep track of events. 
The application is location-based so it is easy to find events nearby or close to the place where the user is going on holiday. 
To make usage easier, all the festivals are divided into four music categories: electro, hip-hop, reggae and rock.
